### compiling this
- **Easy way to obtain from GitHub:** to compile and use this, go to the GitHub page linked to this giant message, then the green button that says "Code", click it and then press "Open with Visual Studio" on the dropdown menu, follow the dialogue, once you reach Visual Studio, press "Clone" in the bottom right of the smaller menu
- **Fixing errors:** This step is important, you may notice that everything is displaying errors, go to just below top of Visual Studio, find a text box called "Debug", click it, then select "Release"
- **Compiling:** Find where it says *Solution 'ExampleHook' (2 of 2 projects)* at the top of the screen, right click this, then select "Build Solution", nothing should error, once its done compiling, right click again on the same solution bar and go down on the meny and select "Open Folder in File Explorer", then open the "x64" folder, then "Release", then run "Injector.exe"
